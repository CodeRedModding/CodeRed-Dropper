## CodeRed Dropper
### .NET 9.0 Windows

Used by [CodeRed Launcher](https://github.com/CodeRedModding/CodeRed-Launcher)'s self updater feature. The launcher downloads a new version and places it in a temp folder, this dropper then closes the launcher and swaps out the old exe with the new version, and then starts the new exe.
